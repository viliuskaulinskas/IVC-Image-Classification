# Image Classification using Bag of Visual Words with SVM and Neural Networks

This two people project is for the Image and vision Computing course at The University of Edinburgh. Repository contains project files for classification of dog and cat images using two different classification methods: classical BoVW/SVM and deep learning model ResNet18. We tested the robustness of models against images with 9 perturbations applied and compared the results.
